                    <p>

                        I am a student at Northwestern University, 
                        where I studied Economics and Global Health as an undergraduate and Public Health
                         for my Master's. I created this webpage as my final project for a computer science course 
                         I took during my final quarter of undergrad about HTML, CSS, Javascript, and overall web design.
                         Thanks for stopping by and getting to know me better!
